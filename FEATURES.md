For users to interact with our updated version of Covey.Town they first need to select a username and either create their own town or join an existing town. 

If they try to make their username the same as someone else’s who is already in the town they get an error and they will need to come up with a new username. 

After they are in a town if they scroll down to the bottom of the screen you can hit a button labeled as “chat”. When this button is clicked the chat feature opens up. If you want to send a chat to everyone in the town you can select “everyone” from the dropdown, type your message in the text field and hit send. If you want to send a chat to someone privately you can select their username from the dropdown, type your message in the text field and hit send. When you send a message to someone privately that message can only be seen by the sender and the receiver, nobody else in the town will have that message show up in their chat. If a user doesn’t want to look at the chat anymore they can hit the “x” button in the top right and they are brought back to just viewing the town and if other users type more messages the number of those new messages will show up in red next to “chat”.
